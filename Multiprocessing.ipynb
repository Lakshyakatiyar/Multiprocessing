    "1.Multiprocessing:\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability to execute multiple processes simultaneously. Each process has its own Python interpreter and memory space, which allows for parallel execution on multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is it useful?:\n",
    "\n",
    "True Parallelism: Unlike multithreading, multiprocessing achieves true parallelism by running separate processes on different CPU cores.\n",
    "Bypassing GIL: Multiprocessing overcomes the limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPython, making it suitable for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "Isolation: Each process has its own memory space, reducing the risk of data corruption and race conditions.\n",
    "Scalability: Better scalability for CPU-intensive tasks, leading to significant performance improvements in multi-core systems."

    "2.Differences between Multiprocessing and Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Execution Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Uses multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
    "Multithreading: Uses multiple threads within a single process, sharing the same memory space.\n",
    "Parallelism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Achieves true parallelism by running processes on multiple CPU cores.\n",
    "Multithreading: Limited by the GIL in CPython, which prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode simultaneously.\n",
    "Resource Sharing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Processes do not share memory space; inter-process communication is required to share data.\n",
    "Multithreading: Threads share the same memory space, making it easier to share data but requiring careful synchronization.\n",
    "Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Suitable for CPU-bound tasks that require heavy computation.\n",
    "Multithreading: Suitable for I/O-bound tasks that involve waiting for external resources.\n",
    "Overhead:\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing: Higher overhead due to process creation and context switching.\n",
    "Multithreading: Lower overhead since threads share the same memory space."
